The WordPress 2024 theme includes a popup that suggests using a pattern when creating new pages. While this can be a helpful feature for some users, it can also be annoying or intrusive for others. If youâ€™re one of those users, you can easily disable the popup using a custom JavaScript script.

## Installation

1. Download the code as a ZIP.
2. Upload to your plugins.
3. Activate.

## To disable

Deactivate the plugin.
